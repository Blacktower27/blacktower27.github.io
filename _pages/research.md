# Research Projects

Here are some of my past research projects in reinforcement learning, robotics, and AI applications.

---

## **Humanoid Robot Motion Imitation**
*Oct. 2024 – Present*  
Developed a control strategy for the humanoid robot **G1** using **imitation learning**, where a well-designed reward function enables the robot to accurately replicate the dynamic motion capture data of professional dancers.

## **Bipedal Robot Locomotion using Reinforcement Learning**
*Oct. 2024 – Present*  
Implemented a **PPO-based stable walking algorithm** for the bipedal robot **Hector** in Isaac Gym, utilizing an asymmetric actor-critic approach.

## **Resource Allocation and Scheduling in IoT & Edge Computing**
*May 2023 – Jan. 2024*  
Designed a **deep reinforcement learning algorithm** for **efficient microservice scheduling** in **edge computing environments**, balancing **latency and resource constraints**.

## **YOLO-based Smoking Detection**
*Personal Project(for fun)*  
Developed a **real-time smoking behavior detection system** using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection model. The system can accurately detect and classify smoking activities in various environments.
