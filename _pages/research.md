## **Humanoid Robot Motion Imitation**
Developed a control strategy for the humanoid robot **G1** using **imitation learning**, where a well-designed reward function enables the robot to accurately replicate the dynamic motion capture data of professional dancers.

## **YOLO-based Smoking Detection**
*Personal Project(for fun)*  
Developed a **real-time smoking behavior detection system** using **YOLO** object detection model. The system can accurately detect and classify smoking activities in various environments.
