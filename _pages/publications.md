### Abstract  
With the rapid growth of **Internet of Things (IoT) devices**, deploying microservices efficiently on resource-constrained edge nodes is a key challenge. Existing container scheduling algorithms often **neglect dynamic computing resource allocation**, assuming uniform CPU distribution, which is impractical.  

This paper formulates an **online microservice scheduling problem** with dynamic computing power to **minimize delay and energy consumption**. We propose a **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning algorithm** integrated with a **GRU-enhanced policy network** and an **action selection mechanism** for faster convergence. Experimental results show that our method **outperforms baseline algorithms by up to 65%** in total performance.

## **A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Initialization of Column Generation with Application to Aircraft Recovery Problem**  
**Authors:** Jingxi Lu, Xiongwen Qian  
**Conference:** LESCDT 2024 - 2nd International Conference on Logistics Engineering, Supply Chain and Digital Transformation, *October 2024*  
**Status:** Accepted, awaiting publication  

### Abstract  
Column Generation is widely used in large-scale combinatorial problems, such as **aircraft recovery**. However, **initializing columns** remains a **critical but underexplored** challenge that directly impacts computational efficiency.  

This paper introduces a **reinforcement learning-based initialization method**, where an agent utilizes a **Graph Attention Network (GAT) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to generate effective initial columns. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly **accelerates column generation** and generalizes well across different network structures.
