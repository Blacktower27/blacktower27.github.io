# About Me

Hello, I’m Jingxi Lu!

I am currently a master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC). My academic journey began at Hong Kong Baptist University, where I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology. I am deeply passionate about researching robotics and reinforcement learning, exploring innovative approaches to enhance intelligent systems.

## Who I Am

- **Background**: I was born in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China,  developed a strong interest in artificial intelligence and robotics. This passion has driven me to explore both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of AI, with a particular focus on deep learning and reinforcement learning in robotics.
- **Professional Experience**: With hands-on experience in robotic control, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning, I have worked on projects like bipedal robot locomotion, humanoid robot imitation, aircraft recovery optimization, and IoT resource scheduling.
- **Personal Interests**: Beyond research, I enjoy basketball and programming. Sports instill in me the resilience to persevere in the face of challenges and the courage to push forward without giving up.

## My Journey & Mission

Through my experiences in robotics research and reinforcement learning, I have realized that there is always a significant gap between simulated environments and the real world. Bridging this gap to make models truly practical and effective is both an ongoing challenge and a key research area. I always believe that an algorithm is truly “useful” when it is also “usable”

## Let’s Connect

I am committed to pursue a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, contributing to the future of embodied intelligence and intelligent robotic control systems. If you share similar research interests, let’s connect and collaborate!
